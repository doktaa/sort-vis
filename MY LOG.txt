Learnt how to use useState hook thing to save state variables (saving user input)

using props in components, in this case passing the array through to display in the display area component

Finding out random things about file structure and imports  (CSS files and stuff)

State (context of constantly changing array while being sorted) is confusing, need to understand it

Dealt with array not updating even though it was being sorted correctly

Learnt that javascript arrays are just references and in order to actually clone an array, have to use [...xyz]

Managed to get sorter working but have to clarify why i had to use [...] syntax for a specific case

Now that bubble sort is a success, will look at refining current solution before adding more sort methods.

Changing functionality so that instead of sort button generating and sorting at the same time, split it up so that there's a button to generate an array based on user input, and a separate sort button

Doing random aesthetic stuff with css here and there

Random playing around with a border on the display area, using a variable to determine whether the display area should show the border or not (if array size is 0 then border should not be visible because it shows by default)

Running into an issue where button does not seem to update react use states on first click, but only updates on 2nd+ clicks...this is causing the generate array button to fail to render/update the graph unless i click it twice...

console log is telling me the usestate setter method for sortArray is not actually updating it.

Research tells me that react hooks run asynchronously which would explain why it wasn't immediately updating the array.

Used useffect() to resolve this issue so that react renders the array only after it changes (so wait till sortArray changes before updating)

ternary operators are sick
